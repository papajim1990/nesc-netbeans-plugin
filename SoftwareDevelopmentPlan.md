# Introduction #
## Project Overview ##
[nesC](http://nescc.sourceforge.net) and [TinyOS](http://www.tinyos.net) are the most used wireless sensor network platform currently. However, most of developers feel intimidated by the lack of tools to develop and verify embedded system built on this platform.

This plugin is trying to promote Netbeans as the default IDE to ease nesC/TinyOS application development / verification.

## Project Deliverables ##
List of project deliverables :
  * Netbeans plugin binary (NBM file)
  * User guide to nesc-netbeans-plugin
  * Tutorial / getting started with to nesc-netbeans-plugin document/wiki
  * Source code

## Reference and Materials ##
  * [Wireless sensor network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_sensor_network)
  * [Netbeans modules learning trail](http://www.netbeans.org/kb/trails/platform.html)

# Project Organization #
## Process Model ##
The project will use iterative process for its lifecycle model.

## Project Major Milestones and Schedule ##
The major milestones of this project are:
  * Planning : Plan the project
  * Requirements gathering : Gather the features that need to be included in the project
  * Proof of concept for feature implementation : Implement features in small scale prototype (to test whether the feature is applicable in Netbeans or not), to be combined in production code.
  * Review Netbeans plugin architecture : Learn the netbeans module architecture, to make the maintenance as easy as possible.
  * First stage release and testing : Release the plugin with limited basic feature.
  * First stage review : Collect user input for modification, and incoming feature.

The project major schedule is described as following chart: ![http://nesc-netbeans-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/project_schedule.jpg](http://nesc-netbeans-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/project_schedule.jpg)
